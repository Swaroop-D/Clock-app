# Clock-app

Hey a challenge for you! Re-create this app within 2 days without seeing any source code and with no help from the internet.

**Challenge consequences:**

- You've to use [IIFEs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE) when starting each script.
- App should have digital as well as analogue
  clock functionality.
- You've to use SASS (SCSS) instead of plain css.
- The app should have background changing every day.
- and you're of course free to add more functionality to the app...ðŸ™‚ Mail me the functional app [here](mailto:swaroopshri2019@gmail.com).

**Note:** You'll have to follow the challenge after this project is complete from my sideðŸ˜‚

This app will help you sharpen your JS skills...(hopefully).

Thanks, please let me know what you think about `${this.challenge};`
